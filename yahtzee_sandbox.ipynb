    "Next I'll try to come up with a reasonably good strategy, similar to the one I try to follow when playing in the real world. Roughly speaking, given the five dice values after the first roll I pick an unused box to \"go for\" and then roll the dice that maximize the probability of hitting the box (or scoring as high as possible in the box, for the upper section) on this turn. For now let's set aside the question of how to pick which box to go for, and focus on figuring out which dice to roll to hit the box.\n",

    "Given `roll_values` and `box`, I need to figure out the `roll_action` for that box, which I define as the one that maximizes the expected score *from that box* when `roll_action` is taken. Note that I am not computing the total expected score from the `roll_action` on `roll_values`, just the expected score that comes from the particular box. The idea is that my agent will simply look at the dice and either take a `ScoreAction` or pick a box to \"roll for\". The advantage of this is that it places a smaller limit on the number of possible actions than considering all possible roll actions. However, there may be cases where this is suboptimal: say `roll_action_1` is the best to hit `SmallStraight` and `roll_action_2` is the best to hit `FullHouse`, but there is some other action `roll_action_3` that has higher sum of expected scores for `SmallStraight` and `FullHouse`. I'll neglect such cases for this agent."
